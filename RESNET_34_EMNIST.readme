1. Performance Metrics

For 10 iterations -

Training Time : 4532.9946 seconds
Test Loss : 0.242057
Test Accuracy : 91.60%
Precision :0.9215
Recall : 0.91847
F1 Score : 0.91638

Observations : 


The model took around 4532.9946 seconds (roughly 1.259 hours) to train.
The model exhibits strong overall performance with high precision, recall, and F1 score, suggesting a good balance between false positives and false negatives.
The accuracy of 91.60% is also relatively high, indicating the model's capability to make correct predictions on the test data.
However, the test loss of 0.242057 might suggest there's still room for improvement in minimizing errors in the model's predictions.
